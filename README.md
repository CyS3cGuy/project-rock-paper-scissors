# Project: Rock,Paper, Scissors, Minus One

This is The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors Javascript.
However, I further enhanced it to become Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One

This is inspired by Squid Game, where it is a variant of traditional rock, paper and scissors.

Note that this game is designed that the computer will try to win.
But don't worry, the program won't cheat by peeping at what gesture you choose. However, it is designed to be very hard to win due to the algorithm behind it, where it will try to choose a gesture that lessen its losing chance based on the player's gesture in first phase - Rock, Paper, Scissors phase.

Remember to watch the video comes with the website to learn how to play.
